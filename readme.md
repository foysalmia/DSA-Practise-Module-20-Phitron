## Task 10
For a sorted array, which of the following algorithms will take less time ? Explain with examples.
 <ol>
    <li>Bubble sort.</li>
  <li>Insertion sort.</li>
 <li>Counting sort.</li>
 </ol>

## Task 11
Write a function named insert_node() that inserts a value at the end of a singly linked list. If there are no nodes, it will insert a head.
## Task 12
Write a function named insert_node_by_position() that inserts a value at any position of the singly linked list. You can assume that if there are 5 nodes in the list, the positions are 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4.
## Task 13
Write a function named delete_node_by_position() that deletes a node from the singly linked list. If there is only one node left, it will delete the head.
## Task 14
Write a function named count_node() to count the number of nodes in that singly linked list.
## Task 15
Write a function named move_tail() which will move the tail to the first position of the list.<br>
For example: If the list looks like this,<br>
List: 2 -> 4 -> 1 -> 10 -> 5<br>
After the operation the list will look like this,<br>
List: 5 -> 2 -> 4 -> 1 -> 10<br>
## Task 16
Write a function insert_node() to insert a value at the end of a doubly linked list. If there are no nodes, it will insert a head.
## Task 17
Write a function named insert_node_by_position() that inserts a value at any position of the doubly linked list. You can assume that if there are 5 nodes in the list, the positions are 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4.
## Task 18
Write a function named delete_node_by_position() that deletes a node from the doubly linked list. If there is only one node left, it will delete the head.
## Task 19
Write a function named move_head() which will move the head to the last position of the list.<br>
For example: If the list looks like this,<br>
List: 2 <-> 4 <-> 1 <-> 10 <-> 5<br>
After the operation the list will look like this,<br>
List: 4 <-> 1 <-> 10 <-> 5 <-> 2<br>
